# labs-sagemaker
## Lab 1
-- Provisions a model using JumpStart
-- JumpStart hosts the model on an instance of your choice
-- Create an endpoint for inference
-- Interacts with the model
-- **WARNING!**
  -- This lab can incur $$$ costs if you provision large instances and leave the endpoint running!

## Lab 2
-- Uses the inference endpoint created in Lab 1
-- Implements SageMaker application-autoscaling
-- Tests the functionality using locust
  -- [text](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/)
-- **WARNING!**
  -- This lab can incur $$$ costs if you provision large instances and leave the endpoint running!
